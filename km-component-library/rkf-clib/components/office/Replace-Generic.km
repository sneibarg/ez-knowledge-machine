	(description ("This is a generic version of Replace.  It may take any kind of Entity as object or base.  By contrast, Replace requires a Tangible for object and base since it involves an Attach and a Detach.  Like with Replace, there are two objects, the one labelled ``old thing'' is removed and the one labeled ``new thing'' is added.  The base is the object from which the old thing is removed and the new thing is added."))
