     Here's how this example might be represented.
     First, the wedding is related to its Time-Interval using the
     <slot>time</slot> relation.  Similarly, the reception is related
     to its Time-Interval. Then, those two Time-Intervals are related 
     by the temporally-meets relation.

<neighborlist>
 <neighbor name=before>
   Asserts that one Time-Interval comes before another
 </neighbor>

 <neighbor name=during>
   Asserts that one Time-Interval is during (completely contained
   within) another
 </neighbor>

 <neighbor name=temporally-overlaps>
   Asserts that one Time-Interval overlaps another, but may not be
   completely contained within it
 </neighbor>

 <neighbor name=temporally-starts>
   Asserts that two Time-Intervals begin together
 </neighbor>

 <neighbor name=temporally-finishes>
   Asserts that two Time-Intervals end together
 </neighbor>
