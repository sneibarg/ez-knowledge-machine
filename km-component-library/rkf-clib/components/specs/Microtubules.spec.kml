<component tag=Microtubules>
  <definition>Long, stiff, cylindrical intracellular structures, 20 
                       nanometers in diameter, composed of the protein tubulin;
                       one of the major components of the cytoskeleton, used
                       by eucaryotic cells to regulate their shape and control
