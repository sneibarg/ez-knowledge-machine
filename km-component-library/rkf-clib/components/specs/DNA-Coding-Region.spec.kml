<h3>Component Semantics:</h3>
<component tag=DNA-Coding-Region>
  <definition>Physical and functional unit of heredity, which carries
                        information from one generation to the next.  In 
                        molecular terms, it is the entire DNA sequence - 
                        including exons, introns, and noncoding transcription 
                        control regions - necessary for production of a 
                        functional protein or RNA. (Lodish:MCB:G-7).
                        Note: this is the definition for gene, but applies to 
                        operons as well.</definition>
