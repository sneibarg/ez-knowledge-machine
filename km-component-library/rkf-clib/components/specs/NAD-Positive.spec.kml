<h3>Component Semantics:</h3>
<component tag=NAD-Positive>
  <definition>Molecule that participates in an oxidatin reaction by
                        accepting a hydride ion (H-) from a donor molecule 
                        thereby producing NADH, which serves as an activated
                        carrier of electrons; important in the energy-producing
                        breakdown of sugars and fats.  Alberts:ECB:G-12.</definition>
