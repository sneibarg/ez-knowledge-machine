     Here's how this example might be represented.
     First, John's wedding is related to its Time-Interval using the
     <slot>time</slot> relation, and John's marriage is similarly
     related to its Time-Interval.  Then, the two Time-Intervals are
     related by the temporally-starts relation.

<neighborlist>
 <neighbor name=before>
   Asserts that one Time-Interval comes before another
 </neighbor>

 <neighbor name=during>
   Asserts that one Time-Interval is during (completely contained
   within) another
 </neighbor>

 <neighbor name=temporally-overlaps>
   Asserts that one Time-Interval overlaps another, but may not be
   completely contained within it
 </neighbor>

 <neighbor name=temporally-meets>
   Asserts that one Time-Interval meets (abuts) another
 </neighbor>

 <neighbor name=temporally-finishes>
