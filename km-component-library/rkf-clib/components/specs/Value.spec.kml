<musing>
This is the top level concept for constants that fill Property slots.
A Value can be Scalar, Categorical or Cardinal.<p>

A <conceptref name=Scalar-Value> is a non-numeric constant that lies on 
one or more ordered Scales. For example, *Hot is a Scalar Value on both the 
*Hot-to-Cold and *Boiling-to-Freezing Scales.<p>

A <conceptref name=Categorical-Value> is a non-numeric constant that does 
not appear in an ordered scale. For example, *Purple is a Categorical Value.<p>

A <conceptref name=Cardinal-Value> is a numeric value and a unit of 
measurement. For example, (98.6 *Degrees-Fahrenheit) is a Cardinal Value.
