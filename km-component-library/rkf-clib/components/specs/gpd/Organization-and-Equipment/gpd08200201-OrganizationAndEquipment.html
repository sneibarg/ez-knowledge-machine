<a name=#Equipment>
<hr noshade size=6 color=#8C3016>

<h2>Equipment and Combat Power</h2>

The equipment possessed by a battalion determines its combat-power as
follows:<p>
<ul>
<li>Any battalion possessing M1 tanks has a default combat power of 1.
<li>The default combat power of other battalions is encoded relative to an
M1 Battalion.
<li>Since a battalion's combat power depends on the equipment it
possesses, battalion combat power is encoded on each type of equipment.
<li>The combat power of a battalion is the maximum combat power encoded
on the equipment it possesses.
</ul>
<p>

Here is the list of military equipment available in SHAKEN. The 
number in parentheses is the combat power of a battalion possessing
the equipment (relative to a battalion possessing M1 tanks).<p>

<a name=#Attrition>
<hr noshade size=6 color=#8C3016>

<h2>Attrition and Force Ratio</h2>

Military tasks in SHAKEN are broken down into Engagement tasks (tasks
that directly affect the combat power of the enemy) and Non-Engagement 
tasks (tasks that do not directly affect the combat power of the enemy).<p>

All military tasks result in the agent of the task suffering some degree 
of attrition. Engagement tasks also result in the enemy suffering 
attrition. Here is a list of the military tasks in SHAKEN and their
associated agent and enemy attrition rates.<p>

Engagement tasks also require a minimum force ratio in order to be
successful. The actual force ratio for a task is the ratio of the
agent's relative combat power to the enemy's relative combat power.
Relative combat power is the product of a unit's default combat
power (see above) and its remaining (attrited) strength.<p>
