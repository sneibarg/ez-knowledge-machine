<h2>Roles</h2>

SHAKEN divides the world into two major kinds of things: <i>Entities</i>
("things that are") and <i>Events</i> ("things that happen"). A <i>Role</i>
represents an Entity's participation in an Event.<p>

Here are some examples of Roles in SHAKEN.<ul>
<li>Barrier
<li>Connector
<li>Container
<li>Food
<li>Product
<li>Vehicle
<li>etc.
</ul><p>

You can see all the Roles currently defined in SHAKEN by expanding
Role in SHAKEN's Browse window. Just click on the
<img src=expandicon.gif align=bottom> symbol next to '<u>Role</u>':<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=Browser.gif><p>

Although Roles look like regular Entities, there are 
important differences:<ol>
<li>Many different kinds of Entities can play the same Role. For
example, just about anything can be considered a Food, as long as
some organism eats it.
<li>An Entity can play many different Roles, depending on what
Events it participates in. For example, a Car can play the Role
of Container, Product and Vehicle (the Role it is <i>intended</i>
to play).
<li>An Entity can stop playing a Role, but it can't stop being an
Entity. For example, you can use chewing gum as a Connector to 
attach two objects. It can stop playing the Role of Connector, but
it can't stop being chewing gum.
</ol>

<h2>How to Use Roles in SHAKEN</h2>

Roles can be added to concept maps, just like Entities and Events.
They can be connected to Entities and Events using special relations.
Usually there are three things involved in representing a Role: the
Role itself, the Entity playing the Role and the Event in which the
Entity is playing the role. For example, to encode the knowledge that
a police car is being used as a barrier to block the road, you would 
say that the PoliceCar is playing the Role of Barrier in a Block 
(with a Road as object):<p>
<center><img src=PoliceCar.gif><p></center>

Note that if we had defined PoliceCar as a kind of Barrier, it would
mean that police cars are a specific kind of Barrier -- not quite
what we want.<p>

Sometimes, however, there is such a strong association between an
Entity and the Role it is <i>intended</i> to play that it is natural
to say that the Entity <i>is</i> that Role. For example, a Fence is
intended to be a Barrier. It is natural to say that a Fence is a
Barrier (not just that Fences happen to be able to play the Role of Barrier).
For such examples in SHAKEN we say that the <i>purpose</i> of a Fence
is to be a Barrier in some Block:<p>
<center><img src=Fence.gif><p></center>

Specifying the purpose of an Entity does not mean that it cannot play
other Roles in other Events. The purpose of PoliceCar is to be a Vehicle,
but it can play the Role of Barrier as well:<p>

<h2>Defining Your Own Roles</h2>

As with Entities and Events, it's possible to define your own Roles
in SHAKEN:<ol>
<li>Choose "Enter Knowledge" from SHAKEN's main menu
<li>then "Create a New Concept".
<li>Enter the name of the new Role and hit the "Continue" button.
<li>When prompted for "an existing concept to start from", type in 
<tt>Role</tt> (or a concept more specific than Role).
<li>Be sure to specify what kind of Entity <i>plays</i> your new Role
(using the <tt>plays</tt> relationship), what Event is involved
(using the <tt>in-event</tt> relationship) and what the relationship
is between that Entity and the Event.
</ol><p>

Here is an example of a newly defined Role. The Role is Student, which
is a Role played by a Person in a Learn Event.<p>

<h2>Is It a Role or an Entity?</h2>

It is not always obvious whether a given concept should be defined as
a Role or simply as an Entity. Most new concepts you define will probably
be Entities. Here is a simple test to help determine if your concept may
be better encoded as a Role. For some new concept called "Flam":<ol>
<li>Can something be a Flam temporarily?
<li>Can something stop being a Flam (without ceasing to exist altogether)?
<li>Can something that isn't intended to be a Flam still be a Flam?
</ol><p>

If the answer to these questions is "Yes", then "Flam" is probably a
Role. Here are some examples to help distinguish Roles and Entities.<p>

<table border=1>
<tr>
<td><center><b><i>Role</i></b></center></td>
<td><center><b><i>Entity</i></b></center></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><dl>
<dt>Shelter</dt>
<dd><i>(a cardboard box can be a Shelter temporarily)</i></dd>
</dl></td>
<td><dl>
<dt>Cave</dt>
<dd><i>(something can't be a Cave temporarily)</i></dd>
</dl></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><dl>
<dt>Teacher</dt>
<dd><i>(you can stop being a Teacher)</i></dd>
</dl></td>
<td><dl>
<dt>Person</dt>
<dd><i>(if you "stop being a Person", you cease to exist)</i></dd>
</dl></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><dl>
<dt>Paper-Weight</dt>
<dd><i>(a Computer isn't </i>intended<i> to be a Paper-Weight, 
but it can still be used as one)</i></dd>
</dl></td>
<td><dl>
<dt>Rock</dt>
<dd><i>(something can't be a rock just because you intend it
to be a rock)</i></dd>
</dl></td>
</tr>

</table><p>

Sometimes a particular Entity is so strongly associated with its
intended Role (its purpose) that the two seem indistinguishable.
Here is a trickier example:<ul>
<li><i>a Screwdriver is an Entity whose purpose is to drive screws<p></i>
<center><img src=Screwdriver.gif><p></center>
It is tempting to define Screwdriver as a Role (anything that is the
instrument of driving screws). Then other things, such as knives, coins 
and thumbnails could play the Screwdriver Role. But the term Screwdriver
so strongly denotes that particular physical object designed to drive
screws that it's probably better to define Screwdriver as an Entity and
say that other things can play the same Role that is the purpose of a
Screwdriver.<p>
