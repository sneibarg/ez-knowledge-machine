<h2>Critique Scores</h2>

SHAKEN allows the user to associate critiquing scores with Patterns
through its Properties mechanism. SHAKEN recognizes twenty-four
"critique dimensions". They are:<ul>
<li>Blue-Reserve-Availability
<li>Casualties
<li>COA-Effectiveness
<li>COA-Efficiency
<li>Command-and-Control
<li>Deception-Operation-Use
<li>Enemy-Artillery-Engagement
<li>Enemy-Maneuver-Engagement
<li>Enemy-Reserve-Force-Engagement
<li>Enemy-Vulnerability-Exploitation
<li>Engagement-of-Main-Elements-of-Enemy-Combat-Power
<li>Logistics-Support
<li>Maneuver-Effectiveness
<li>Mission-Accomplishment
<li>Position-for-Follow-On
<li>Preparedness-for-Enemy-Response
<li>Relative-Combat-Power
<li>Resource-Use
<li>Risk
<li>Security
<li>Simplicity
<li>Synchronization
<li>Time-Constraints
<li>Use-of-Terrain
</ul><p>

A Pattern is rated on one or more of these dimensions. Ratings are
taken from a four-point scale: very poor, poor, good, very good.
For example, a Pattern might be rated poor with respect to Risk
but very good with respect to Time-Constraints.<p>

The rest of this document is meant as a guide to show how to
associate critique scores with a Pattern by way of an example. The
example Pattern may be overly simple (a Brigade crossing a narrow
bridge), but it serves to illustrate critique scores.<p>

The Pattern in the example is called <tt>Brigade-on-Bridge</tt>.
It was defined as a new concept, based on the more general concept
of <tt>Pattern</tt>. Since it was based on <tt>Pattern</tt>, it 
automatically includes the knowledge associated with <tt>Pattern</tt>.
Right-click on <tt>Brigade-on-Bridge</tt> and select <tt>Show Complete
Description</tt> to see what knowledge is associated with it.<p>

<center><img src=Bridge02.gif></center><p>

Every concept built from <tt>Pattern</tt> automatically has a 
<tt>Critique-Score-Value</tt> associated with it.<p>

<center><img src=Bridge03.gif></center><p>

In order to express the knowledge that having a Brigade cross a
bridge is dangerous, we would like to give <tt>Brigade-on-Bridge</tt>
a rating on the Risk dimension. To associate a Risk rating with 
<tt>Brigade-on-Bridge</tt>, right-click on the 
<tt>Critique-Score-Value</tt> and select <tt>Properties...</tt> from 
the menu.<p>

<center><img src=Bridge04.gif></center><p>

A new window pops up called <tt>Critique-Score-Value Properties</tt>.
There are three "tabs" near the top of the window. Click on the tab
called <tt>Values</tt>. This is where you are allowed to add, change
or remove critique dimension ratings.
To choose a rating of <tt>verypoor</tt>, <tt>poor</tt>, <tt>good</tt>
or <tt>verygood</tt> to associate with the rating, you must first
select <tt>Critique-Score-Value</tt> in the box at the bottom left of
the <tt>Critique-Score-Value Properties</tt> window.<p>

<center><img src=Bridge05.gif></center><p>

You now must specify the critique dimension you wish to rate. Click
on the <tt>Specialize...</tt> button 
in the <tt>Critique-Score-Value Properties</tt> window.<p>

<center><img src=Bridge06.gif></center><p>

A new window pops up called <tt>Specialize concept</tt>. Type in
the name of the critique dimension you want to rate. You must type
in one of the twenty-four dimensions listed at the beginning of 
this document, and it must be typed in exactly as shown (hyphens
and capitalization are important).<p>

<center><img src=Bridge07.gif></center><p>

The last step is to choose one of the four rating values. These
appear in a drop-down menu as <tt>*rating-verypoor</tt>,
<tt>*rating-poor</tt>, <tt>*rating-good</tt>, <tt>*rating-verygood</tt>.<p>

<center><img src=Bridge08.gif></center><p>

To store your rating, click on the <tt>Add</tt> button in the
<tt>Critique-Score-Value Properties</tt> window. You should see
your critique score of <tt>*rating-poor&nbsp;Risk</tt> ("poor with respect 
to Risk") appear under <tt>Defined Properties</tt>. Click on the 
<tt>Ok</tt> button when you're done.<p>

<center><img src=Bridge09.gif></center><p>

Your critique score rating should appear in the green
<tt>Critique-Score-Value</tt> box.<p>

<center><img src=Bridge11.gif></center><p>

You can specify ratings for as many of the twenty-four dimensions
as you want on a Pattern. Simply repeat the steps in this example
typing in a different critique dimension in the <tt>Specialize concept</tt>
window. All the ratings you define will appear in the green
<tt>Critique-Score-Value</tt> box.<p>
