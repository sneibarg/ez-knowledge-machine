<h3>Component Semantics:</h3>
<component tag=Be-Broken>
  <definition>object unable to serve its function</definition>
  <requiredslot name=object>
    <restriction>has a function slot: <slot>object</slot> plays some
      role in some Event</requirement>
    <restriction><slot>object</slot> must not play that role in any such Event
    </restriction>
  </requiredslot>

<musing>
The restriction that an <slot>object</slot> of Be-Broken not serve its
function could be handled in slot semantics. For example, an 
<slot>instrument</slot> of an Event must not be filled by an Entity
whose function it is to fill that slot in such an Event.
