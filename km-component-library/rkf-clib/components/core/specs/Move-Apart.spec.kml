<neighborlist>

  <neighbor name=Disperse>
    Disperse is the reflexive version of Move-Apart (i.e. the agent
    and the object are the same). Its opposite is come-together.   
  </neighbor>

  <neighbor name=Move-Together>
    Move-Together is the opposite of Move-Apart, and should be used
    when specifying several objects moving to the same destination. 
  </neighbor>

  <neighbor name=Come-Together>
    Come-Together is the reflexive version of Move-Together (i.e.
    the agent and the object are not the same). Its opposite is 
    Disperse.
  </neighbor>
