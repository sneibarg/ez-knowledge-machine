<comment>
An object being in a <conceptref name=Be-Restrained> state affects the 
actions that can be done on it (i.e. the object is unable to <conceptref name=Move>). 
There are actions that put an object into this state (<conceptref name=Restrain>), 
and that take an object out of this state (<conceptref name=Unrestrain>).
