<musing>
This is the top level concept for Events that have to do with doing
or changing. Actions may be purely active (like <conceptref name=Locomotion>),
purely passive (like <conceptref name=Fall>) or something in between
(like the intransitive <conceptref name=Break>). Actions often correspond
to changes in <conceptref name=State>.
