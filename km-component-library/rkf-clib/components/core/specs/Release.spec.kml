<concept name=Release><system-documentation name=Release>
<superconcept name=Unobstruct>

<definition>

  Allow some thing to leave an enclosure or container.

</definition>

<requiredslotlist>

  <slotdescription name=object>
     Some tangible entity.
     Before this action, the object is
     assumed to be confined by the container, i.e. it's in a state of
     <conceptref name=Be-Confined>.
     Afterwards it's no longer in that state.
  </slotdescription>

  <slotdescription name=base>
     A container that's confining the object.
  </slotdescription>

</requiredslotlist>

<primaryslotlist>

  <slotdescription name=agent>
    the entity that causes the release
  </slotdescription>

  <slotdescription name=instrument>
    the thing (e.g. tool) used to release the object
  </slotdescription>

  <slotdescription name=by-means-of>
    the event that facilitates releasing the object
  </slotdescription>

</primaryslotlist>

<examplesentencelist>

  <examplesentence>
    <text>John released Fido from the pen with wire cutters.</text>
    <slotdescription name=base>the pen</slotdescription>
    <slotdescription name=object>Fido</slotdescription>
    <slotdescription name=agent>John</slotdescription>
    <slotdescription name=instrument>wire cutters</slotdescription>
  </examplesentence>

  <comment>
    It's assumed that Fido was confined to the pen beforehand.

<neighborlist>

  <neighbor name=Detach> 
     Detach removes an attachment between two objects, whereas
     Release frees an object from
     its confinement in a container.
  </neighbor>

  <neighbor name=Take-Apart> 
     Take-Apart disassembles an object by removing all of its parts, whereas
     Release frees an object from its confinement in a container.
  </neighbor>

  <neighbor name=Break-Contact> 
     Break-Contact terminates the contact between two objects.
  </neighbor>

  <neighbor name=Unobstruct> 
     Unobstruct is more general than Release.
     Unobstruct allows some object to move more freely, whereas
     Release (more specifically) frees an object from
     its confinement in a container.
  </neighbor>

  <neighbor name=Move-Out-Of>
     Release <i>allows</i> an object to move out of a container, whereas 
     Move-Out-Of is the act of actually doing it.
  </neighbor>

</neighborlist>
