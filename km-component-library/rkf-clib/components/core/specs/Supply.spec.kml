  <neighbor name=Give>
       In a give action, a donor relinquishes an object and the
       recipient takes possession of it. In contrast, in a supply 
       action, the donor relinquishes an object in order to enable
       it to replenish a resource; the recipient does not necessarily
       gain possession, at least not immediately.
