<h3>Component Semantics:</h3>
<component tag=Role>
  <definition>When some <conceptref name=Entity> participates in some
    <conceptref name=Event>, we say the Entity is playing a role.  For 
    example, a person who's driving a car is a Driver. More precisely,
    the person who participates in Driving as an <slot>agent</slot>
    is playing the role of Driver.)
  </definition> </component>

  Contrast Roles with <conceptref name=Entity>'s.
