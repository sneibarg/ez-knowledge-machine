Spatially oriented toward in at least one of
several possible senses of `oriented toward'. It could mean, for
example, that Spatial-Entity<sub>from</sub> is tilted toward
Spatial-Entity<sub>to</sub>, or Spatial-Entity<sub>from</sub> faces
Spatial-Entity<sub>to</sub> (but see is-facing), or the major axis of
Spatial-Entity<sub>from</sub> points toward
Spatial-Entity<sub>to</sub>, or Spatial-Entity<sub>from</sub> has a
rotational axis toward Spatial-Entity<sub>to</sub>, etc .
