<superconcept name=Action>

  <definition>
	substitute one <slot>object</slot> (labelled "new thing") 
        for another <slot>object</slot> (labelled "old thing"). 
	The "old thing" is first <conceptref name=Detach>ed from the 
	<slot>base</slot> (the object it is <conceptref name=Attach>ed to). 
	Then, the "new thing" is <conceptref name=Attach>ed to the
        <slot>base</slot>.
  </definition>

<requiredslotlist>

  <slotdescription name=object>
     	this holds both the entity that is replaced (labelled "old
        thing") and the one which replaces it (labelled "new thing").
        Note that the 2 objects MUST 
        be given exactly these labels (called Properties in SHAKEN).
  </slotdescription>

  <slotdescription name=base>
     	the object that the "old thing" 
        is <conceptref name=Detach>ed from during
	the <conceptref name=Replace>. This is also 
        the object to which the "new thing"
	is <conceptref name=Attach>ed.

  <subeventdescription name=Attach>
    	the <slot>object</slot> labelled "new thing" 
        is <conceptref name=Attach>ed to

    <text>Mick replaced the blown fuse from the socket with a new one.</text>
    <slotdescription name=agent>Mick</slotdescription>
    <slotdescription name=object>blown fuse</slotdescription>
    <slotdescription name=object>new fuse</slotdescription>
    <slotdescription name=base>socket</slotdescription>
  <comment>
    The first object (the blown fuse) must be given the label 
    "old thing" and the second object (the new fuse) must be given
    the label "new thing".  In SHAKEN labels are assigned as Properties;
    In KM labels are assigned with the keyword "called".
