A <conceptref name=Physical-Document> is like a Physical-Mark in that
both are the result of <conceptref name=Embody> events.  However, a
<conceptref name=Physical-Document> also includes the medium
(e.g. paper) whereas Physical-Mark is merely the trail left in
writing, for example.  A <conceptref name=Physical-Document> has a
Physical-Mark as a part.
