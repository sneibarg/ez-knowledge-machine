     This says that the fireman created a hole in the wall.  If,
     in addition, the fireman went through the hole, use
     <conceptref name=Penetrate> instead.

<neighborlist>

  <neighbor name=Break>
     Any type of object can break (thereby losing its functionality),
     but only a barrier can be breached.
  </neighbor>
  
  <neighbor name=Penetrate>
     A penetrate involves two steps.  First a barrier is breached,
     then some object passes through the portal created by the breach.
     Frequently, this is more useful than Breach alone.
