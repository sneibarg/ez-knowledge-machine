<hr>
<h3>Component Semantics:</h3>
<component tag=Entity>
  <definition>"Things that are", such as <conceptref name=Physical-Object>s and <conceptref name=Substance>s, as opposed to "Things that happen".</definition>
</component>

<musing>
This is the top level concept for concepts that participate in 
<conceptref name=Action>s and exist in <conceptref name=State>s.<p>

Contrast Entities with <conceptref name=Event> concepts.
