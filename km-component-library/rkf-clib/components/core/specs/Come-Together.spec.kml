<superconcept name=Action>

<definition>

  Several <slot>object</slot>s change their own location to 
  the same <conceptref name=Place>, which is the destination. 
  Come-Together is an <conceptref name=Action> 
  involving multiple <slot>object</slot>s that <conceptref name=Go-To>
  the <slot>destination</slot>.

  <slotdescription name=object>
    the things that move together 
  </slotdescription>

  <slotdescription name=destination>
    the place where the <slot>object</slot>s come together
  </slotdescription>

<primaryslotlist>

  <slotdescription name=agent>
    Each <slot>object</slot> that comes together does so under 
    its own power. As a result, the <slot>agent</slot> and the 
    <slot>object</slot> are the same.
  </slotdescription>

  <slotdescription name=path>
     the Place which the <slot>object</slot>s move
     along.  Typically, this is an object or surface along which the
     <slot>object</slot>s are moving
  </slotdescription>

  <slotdescription name=toward>
    the location toward which the <slot>object</slot>s move.  Unlike the 
    <slot>destination</slot>, the <slot>object</slot>s need not reach this
    Place, but they may
  </slotdescription>

  <slotdescription name=away-from>
    the location that the <slot>object</slot>s move away from.  Unlike the 
    <slot>origin</slot>, the <slot>object</slot>s need not start at this
    Place, but they may
  </slotdescription>

  <subeventdescription name=Go-To>
    for each <slot>object</slot> there is a <conceptref name=Go-To> where

    Here "met" is translated to "come-together" involving the boy
    and his date.

<neighborlist>

  <neighbor name=Move-Together>
    Move-Together is the non-reflexive version of Come-Together (i.e.
    the objects that move together are not necessarily acting by their
    own volition.  Rather, the agent causes the objects to move).
    Its opposite is Move-Apart.
  </neighbor>

  <neighbor name=Disperse>
    Disperse is the opposite of Come-Together, and should be used
    when specifying several objects leaving some place by their own
    volition.    
  </neighbor>

  <neighbor name=Move-Apart>
    Move-Apart is the non-reflexive version of Disperse (i.e. the
    objects that move apart are not necessarily acting by their own
    volition.) Its opposite is Move-Together.
  </neighbor>
