   Embody is the first step of <conceptref name=Convey> (which itself 
   is a step of <conceptref name=Communicate>). For perspective, 
   here's the overall model of convey.  First, a <conceptref name=Message>
   is embodied as a Tangible-Entity. Second, that entity, playing the role
   of a <conceptref name=Signal>, is <conceptref name=Transmit>ed to
   a <slot>recipient</slot>. Finally, the signal is <conceptref name=Sense>d
   by the recipient and converted back into a message.

   The <conceptref name=Language> of the communication is a feature of the
   <conceptref name=Message>.
