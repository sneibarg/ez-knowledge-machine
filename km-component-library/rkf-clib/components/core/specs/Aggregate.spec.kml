  <definition>
     An Aggregate is a collection of <conceptref name=Entity>s.
     There are various types of aggregates which vary in the
     constraints imposed on the elements of the collection.  
     See the table below.
  </definition>

<requiredslotlist>
   There are no slots that are required for an aggregate.

<primaryslotlist>

  <slotdescription name=element>
    the individual entities that comprise the aggregate.
  </slotdescription>

  <slotdescription name=number-of-elements>
    the number of elements in the aggregate

     <text>a collection of Moe, Larry, and Curly</text>
     <slotdescription name=element>Moe, Larry, Curly</slotdescription>
  <comment>
     Optionally, you might also assert that the <slot>size</slot> 
     is three, 
     although this information is redundant since the system can 
     infer it from the list of elements.
