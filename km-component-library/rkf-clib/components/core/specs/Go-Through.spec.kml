<concept name=Go-Through><system-documentation name=Go-Through>
<superconcept name=Move-Through>

<definition>

  An <slot>agent</slot> changes its own location by moving through some place
  or along some path.

</definition>

<requiredslotlist>


  <slotdescription name=agent>
     the entity that moves.
  </slotdescription>
  <comment>
     Go-Through is a type of self-movement, i.e. the agent moves itself.
     Therefore, the
     <slot>agent</slot> (the entity that causes the move) is the same
     as the <slot>object</slot> (the thing being moved).
  </comment>

  <slotdescription name=path>
     the Place which the <slot>object</slot> moves
     along or through.  Typically, this is an object or surface along
     which, or through which, the <slot>object</slot> is moving.
  </slotdescription>

</requiredslotlist>

<primaryslotlist>

  <slotdescription name=origin>
    the initial location of the <slot>object</slot> before the move.
  </slotdescription>

  <slotdescription name=destination>
    the final location of the <slot>object</slot> after the move.
  </slotdescription>

  <slotdescription name=toward>
    the location toward which the <slot>object</slot> moves.  Unlike the 
    <slot>destination</slot>, the <slot>object</slot> need not reach this
    Place, but it may.
  </slotdescription>

  <slotdescription name=away-from>
    the location that the <slot>object</slot> moves away from.  Unlike the 
    <slot>origin</slot>, the <slot>object</slot> need not start at this
    Place, but it may.
  </slotdescription>
