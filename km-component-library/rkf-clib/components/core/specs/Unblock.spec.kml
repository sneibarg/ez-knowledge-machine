<concept name=Unblock><system-documentation name=Unblock>
<superconcept name=Make-Accessible>

<definition>

  Allow things to move through some place, or along some object, which
  was previously blocked.

</definition>

<requiredslotlist>

  <slotdescription name=object>
     The object or place that becomes unblocked.  It's assumed to be 
     in a <conceptref name=Be-Blocked> state before this
     action is taken, and afterwards it's no longer in that state.
  </slotdescription>

</requiredslotlist>

<primaryslotlist>

  <slotdescription name=agent>
    the entity that causes this action
  </slotdescription>

  <slotdescription name=instrument>
    the thing (e.g. tool) used to unblock the object.
  </slotdescription>

</primaryslotlist>

<musing>
  The slots used to describe <conceptref name=Make-Accessible> actions
  in general, can be used here, too.  For example, 
  <slot>destination</slot> and <slot>by-means-of</slot>.
</musing>

  <examplesentence>
    <text>The policeman removed the barricade on the sidewalk.</text>
    <slotdescription name=object>the sidewalk</slotdescription>
    <slotdescription name=agent>the policeman</slotdescription>
    <slotdescription name=by-means-of>move the barricade</slotdescription>
  </examplesentence>
  <comment>
      The sidewalk is the object that becomes unblocked by this action;
      it becomes accessible to things moving along it, such as pedestrians.
      Also note that "remove" here means "move".

  <examplesentence>
    <text>When the rubble was removed, the passageway became free.</text>
    <slotdescription name=object>the passageway</slotdescription>
    <slotdescription name=by-means-of>removal of the rubble</slotdescription>
  </examplesentence>
  <comment>
      The passageway (a place) became unblocked, so things were able to
      move through it.
