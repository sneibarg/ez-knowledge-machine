<comment>
Unlike the other <conceptref name=Be-Obstructed> states, Be-Held has
an <slot>agent</slot>. Any <conceptref name=Move> of an <slot>object</slot>
in a Be-Held state must be done by the <slot>agent</slot> of the
Be-Held and only this <slot>agent</slot> can <conceptref name=Let-Go-Of> 
the <slot>object</slot>.<p>

<conceptref name=Let-Go-Of> takes an <slot>object</slot> out of a Be-Held
state. <conceptref name=Hold> puts the <slot>object</slot> into the
Be-Held state.
