<concept name=Collide><system-documentation name=Collide>
<superconcept name=Make-Contact>

<definition>

  One <slot>object</slot> collides with another.  The objects 
  <conceptref name=Make-Contact> with high <slot>intensity</slot>.

  There are two types of collision:<ul>
    <li>symmetric collision, such as occurs between 2 billiard balls.
    <li>asymmetric collision, such as occurs when a baseball bat hits
      a baseball or a car hits a lamp-post
</ul>

</definition>

<requiredslotlist>

  <slotdescription name=object>
    for a symmetric collision, give two <slot>object</slot>s.  For an
    asymmetric collision, give one <slot>object</slot> and one
    <slot>base</slot>.  See examples below.
  </slotdescription>

</requiredslotlist>

<primaryslotlist>
  <slotdescription name=agent>
    the entity that caused the collision
  </slotdescription>

  <slotdescription name=base>
    the thing that is hit by the <slot>object</slot>.  Used only for
    asymmetric collisions
  </slotdescription>

  <slotdescription name=location>
    the Place where the collision occurred
  </slotdescription>

    with high <slot>intensity</slot>
