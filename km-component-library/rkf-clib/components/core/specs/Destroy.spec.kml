     You would no longer call the object a vase after John 
     destroyed it.  It ceases to exist, even though pieces of 
     the vase continue to exist.

     This might be a bit exaggerated.  Use <conceptref name=Break> 
     to say that the car ceases to perform its function, or use
     <conceptref name=Ruin> to say that the car cannot be repaired.
