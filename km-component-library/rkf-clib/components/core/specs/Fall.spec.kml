<comment>
  Note that fall is purely intransitive, i.e. it can never have an
  <slot>agent</slot>.  However, <conceptref name=Let-Fall>, which
  causes a fall to occur, always has an agent.

  <slotdescription name=origin>
    the initial location of the <slot>object</slot> before the fall
  </slotdescription>

  <slotdescription name=destination>
    the final location of the <slot>object</slot> after the fall
  </slotdescription>

  <slotdescription name=path>
     the Place which the <slot>object</slot> moves
     along during the fall.  Typically, this is an object or surface
     along which the <slot>object</slot> falls.
  </slotdescription>

  <slotdescription name=toward>
    the location toward which the <slot>object</slot> falls.  Unlike the 
    <slot>destination</slot>, the <slot>object</slot> need not reach this
    Place, but it may.
  </slotdescription>

  <slotdescription name=away-from>
    the location that the <slot>object</slot> moves away from during
    the fall.  Unlike the
    <slot>origin</slot>, the <slot>object</slot> need not start at this
    Place, but it may.
