<neighbor name=Print>

<conceptref name=Print> is a more specific type of 
<conceptref name=Mark> in which the result is, by definition, a 
<conceptref name=Physical-Document>.  With <conceptref name=Mark>, a 
<conceptref name=Physical-Document> *may* be the result, or it may be something
less document-like (e.g. spray paint on a subway car).

</neighbor>

<neighbor name=Write>

The object of (or input to) a <conceptref name=Write> is an instance
of <conceptref name=Information> whereas the object of a <conceptref
name=Mark> is a <conceptref name=Message>.  Also, a <conceptref
name=Write> results in an intangible <conceptref name=Message>,
specifically a <conceptref name=Document> whereas <conceptref
name=Mark> results in a <conceptref name=Physical-Mark>.
