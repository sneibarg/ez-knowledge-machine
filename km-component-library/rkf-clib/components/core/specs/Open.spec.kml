<concept name=Open><system-documentation name=Open>
<superconcept name=Unblock>

<definition>

</definition>

<requiredslotlist>

  <slotdescription name=object>
     The <conceptref name=Spatial-Entity> that is Open'ed and takes on
     the role of a Portal.  This action changes the state of the object,
     from <conceptref name=Be-Closed> to <conceptref name=Be-Open>.
  </slotdescription>

</requiredslotlist>

<primaryslotlist>

  <slotdescription name=agent>
    the entity that causes this action
  </slotdescription>

  <slotdescription name=instrument>
    the entity that played the role of <conceptref name=Portal-Covering> 
    before the Portal was Opened.  This action

  </slotdescription>

</primaryslotlist>

<comment>
  The slots used to describe <conceptref name=Make-Accessible> actions
  in general can be used here, too.  For example, 
  <slot>destination</slot> and <slot>by-means-of</slot>.
