</definition>

<requiredslotlist>

  <slotdescription name=object>
     The <conceptref name=Portal> that is closed.  This action
     changes the state of the object,

<comment>
  The slots used to describe <conceptref name=Make-Inaccessible> actions
  in general can be used here, too.  For example, 
  <slot>destination</slot> and <slot>by-means-of</slot>.
