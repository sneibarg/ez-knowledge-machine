<definition>

  The <slot>experiencer</slot> derives a <conceptref name=Message>

   Sense is the third and final step of <conceptref name=Convey> (which itself 
   is a step of <conceptref name=Communicate>). For perspective, 
   here's the overall model of convey.  First, a <conceptref name=Message>
   is <conceptref name=Embody>'ed as a Tangible-Entity. 
   Second, that entity, playing the role
   of a <conceptref name=Signal>, is <conceptref name=Transmit>ed to
   the <slot>recipient</slot>s. Finally, the signal is sensed
   by the recipient and converted back into a message.
