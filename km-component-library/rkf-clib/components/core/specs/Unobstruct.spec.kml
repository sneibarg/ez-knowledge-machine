<neighborlist>

  <neighbor name=Make-Accessible> 
     Make-Accessible is more general than Unobstruct.  
     Unobstruct applies only to 
     the movement of things that were previously obstructed.
  </neighbor>

  <neighbor name=Open>
     Open applies only to portal coverings, and the movement of 
     things through portals.
  </neighbor>

  <neighbor name=Unblock>
     Unblock makes a path accessible, whereas Unobstruct allows
     some thing to move freely.
