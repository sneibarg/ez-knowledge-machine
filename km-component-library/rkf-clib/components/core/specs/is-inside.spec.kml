    If an entity is the <slot>content</slot> of a container, then 
    the entity <slot>is-inside</slot> the container.  Therefore, 
    the first statement subsumes the second.  However, the first 
    statement implies additional information.  If an entity is the 
    <slot>content</slot> of a container, not only is it inside (which 
    is a structural assertion), it is also restricted from leaving 
    and restricted from interacting with entities outside the
    container (which are functional assertions).
