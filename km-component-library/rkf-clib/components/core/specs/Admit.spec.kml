<concept name=Admit><system-documentation name=Admit>
<superconcept name=Unobstruct>

<definition>

  Allow some thing to move into a container.

</definition>

<requiredslotlist>

  <slotdescription name=base>
     The container that the object is admitted into.
  </slotdescription>
  <slotdescription name=object>
     Some tangible entity that is located outside base.
     Before the object is admitted to the container, it is
     assumed to be in a state of <conceptref name=Be-Shut-Out>
     of that container.  Afterwards it's no longer in that state.
     
     Note that Admit does not cause the object to move into the
     container; it only permits <conceptref name=Move-Into> to occur.
  </slotdescription>

</requiredslotlist>

<primaryslotlist>

  <slotdescription name=agent>
    the entity that causes this action
  </slotdescription>

  <slotdescription name=instrument>
    the thing (e.g. tool) used to admit the object
  </slotdescription>

  <slotdescription name=by-means-of>
    the event that admits the object
  </slotdescription>

    <text>John was admitted to the secret chamber by saying the magic
          words.</text>
    <slotdescription name=base>the secret chamber</slotdescription>
    <slotdescription name=object>John</slotdescription>

      Note that the secret chamber is being viewed as a container here.
      Also, note that it's assumed that John was shut-out of the
      secret chamber before he was admitted.

<neighborlist>

  <neighbor name=Unobstruct> 
     Unobstruct is more general than Admit.  
     Unobstruct allows some object to move more freely, whereas
     Admit (more specifically) allows an object into a container.
  </neighbor>

  <neighbor name=Move-Into>
     Admit <i>allows</i> an object to move into a container, whereas 
     Move-Into is the act of actually doing it.
  </neighbor>
