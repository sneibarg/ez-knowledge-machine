<neighborlist>

  <neighbor name=Move>
    Slide is a type of Move with two extra properties: the object 
    moves along some object or surface, and throughout the move the 
    object touches it.
  </neighbor>

  <neighbor name=Move-Through>
    Slide is a type of Move-Through with one extra property: 
    throughout the move the object touches the path it's moving along.
  </neighbor>

  <neighbor name=Traverse>
    Traverse involves some entity moving itself, while Slide can be
    used to describe one entity causing another entity to move.  
    Also, Slide requires that the moving object is always touching 
    the path.
