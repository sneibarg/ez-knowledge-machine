  <comment>
     It is not necessary to specify a <slot>number-of-elements</slot> or to list the 
     <slot>element</slot> of an ensemble. If you do, the system will try 
     to maintain consistency by requiring that the number of <slot>element
     </slot> is at least as large as the specified <slot>number-of-elements</slot>
