<concept name=Detach><system-documentation name=Detach>
<superconcept name=Action>

<definition>

  Detach an <slot>object</slot> from a <slot>base</slot> by removing 
  the link that connects them. The detach action encodes an asymmetric 
  detach, such as unhitching a trailer from a truck.  Therefore, a detach
  action is described with one <slot>object</slot> (e.g. the trailer) 
  and one <slot>base</slot> (e.g. the truck).

<neighborlist>

  <neighbor name=Release> 
     Release frees an object from its confinement in a container, whereas
     Detach removes an attachment between two objects.
  </neighbor>

  <neighbor name=Take-Apart> 
     Take-Apart disassembles an object by removing all of its parts from 
     the whole.
  </neighbor>

  <neighbor name=Break-Contact>
    An object and a base may break contact if they are merely touching.  
    In contrast, an object and a base must be attached for them to be 
    detached.
