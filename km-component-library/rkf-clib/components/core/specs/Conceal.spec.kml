<neighborlist>

  <neighbor name=Obstruct>
     Obstruct affects the movement of something, but does not conceal it.
     Conceal doesn't necessarily prevent an object from being moved, or
     having any other particular action done to it.
  </neighbor>
  
  <neighbor name=Make-Inaccessible>
     Conceal is more specific than Make-Inaccessible. Concealment is a 
     particular kind of inaccessibility: inaccessible to view.
