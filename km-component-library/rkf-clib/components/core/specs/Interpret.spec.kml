<concept name=Interpret><system-documentation name=Interpret>
<superconcept name=Action>

<definition>

  An <slot>agent</slot> interprets a message, gleaning 
  <conceptref name=Information> from it.  The agent comes to know
  that information as a result.

</definition>

  <comment>
    Interpret is the third and final step of <conceptref name=Communicate>.
    For perspective, here's the overall model of communication.
    Information is first converted into a message by the 
    <conceptref name=Express> subevent, then the message is moved 
    to the recipient by the <conceptref name=Convey> subevent, 
    and finally the message is converted back into information 
    by this subevent.

<requiredslotlist>

  <slotdescription name=agent>
     the <conceptref name=Tangible-Entity> that receives and interprets 
     the message
  </slotdescription>

  <slotdescription name=object>
     the <conceptref name=Message> that is interpreted
  </slotdescription>
	
</requiredslotlist>

<comment>
   As a result of this action, the <slot>result</slot> becomes the
   <conceptref name=Information> that was encoded in the message, and
   the <slot>agent</slot> comes to know that information (i.e. the
   information becomes the <slot>object</slot> of a 
   <conceptref name=Be-Known> state in which the <slot>experiencer</slot>
   is the <slot>agent</slot> of this interpret action.

<neighborlist>

  <neighbor name=Learn>
    Learn is a sub type of Interpret in which the information encoded 
    in the message is new to the agent interpreting it
  </neighbor>

  <neighbor name=Forget>
    Forget is the opposite of Interpret; it causes an entity to cease
    knowing some information
