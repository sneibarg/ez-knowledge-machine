<concept name=Move-Together><system-documentation name=Move-Together>
<superconcept name=Action>

<definition>

  Several <slot>object</slot>s change their own location to 
  the same <conceptref name=Place>, which is the destination. 
  Move-Together is an <conceptref name=Action> 
  involving multiple <slot>object</slot>s that <conceptref name=Move> to
  the <slot>destination</slot>.
  
  The difference between Move-Together and <conceptref name=Come-Together>
  is that Come-Together is reflexive (i.e. the objects move
  themselves) and Move-Together is not.

    the entity that caused the move together to occur.
  </slotdescription>

  <slotdescription name=path>
     the Place which the <slot>object</slot>s move

     <slot>object</slot>s are moving
  </slotdescription>

  <slotdescription name=toward>
    the location toward which the <slot>object</slot>s move.  Unlike the 
    <slot>destination</slot>, the <slot>object</slot>s need not reach this
    Place, but they may
  </slotdescription>

  <slotdescription name=away-from>
    the location that the <slot>object</slot>s move away from.  Unlike the 
    <slot>origin</slot>, the <slot>object</slot>s need not start at this
    Place, but they may

<subeventlist>
    
  <subeventdescription name=Move>
    for each <slot>object</slot> there is a <conceptref name=Move> where
    the <slot>destination</slot> is the <slot>destination</slot> of the
    Move-Together and the <slot>agent</slot> is the <slot>agent</slot> of
    the Move-Together.

    There are several "move"s occurring together which is translated 
    to "move-together".

<neighborlist>


  <neighbor name=Come-Together>
    Come-Together is the reflexive version of Move-Together (i.e.
    the objects that move are acting by their own volition, so the agent
    and the object of Come-Together are the same). Its opposite is
    Disperse.
  </neighbor>

  <neighbor name=Disperse>
    Disperse is the opposite of Come-Together, and should be used
    when specifying several objects leaving some place by their own
    volition.    
  </neighbor>

  <neighbor name=Move-Apart>
    Move-Apart is the non-reflexive version of Disperse (i.e. the
    objects that move apart are not necessarily acting by their own
    volition.) Its opposite is Move-Together.
