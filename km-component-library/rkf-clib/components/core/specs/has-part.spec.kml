 <neighbor name=material>
   The parts of an object are themselves objects, whereas the 
   <slot>material</slot> of an object is the substance it's made of.
   For example, the parts of a chair include its seat and armrests, 
   whereas the <slot>material</slot> of a chair might be wood or
   metal.
 </neighbor>

 <neighbor name=has-region>
   A <slot>has-region</slot> references a place, whereas <slot>has-part</slot> 
   references an object.  For example, the tip of my umbrella is 
   a region; however, if the tip was a discrete object that was
   attached to my umbrella, then it would be a part.   
 </neighbor>

 <neighbor name=has-functional-part>
   A <slot>has-functional-part</slot> is more specific than 
   <slot>has-part</slot>. It refers to parts that play some role in the
   functioning of the whole.
 </neighbor>

 <neighbor name=has-structural-part>
   A <slot>has-structural-part</slot> is more specific than 
   <slot>has-part</slot>. It refers to physical parts that make up the
   structure of the whole, but don't necessarily serve a particular
   function in the whole.
 </neighbor>

 <neighbor name=has-basic-structural-unit>
   A <slot>has-basic-structural-unit</slot> is more specific than 
   <slot>has-part</slot>. It refers to the many identical physical
   things that make up a whole.
 </neighbor>

 <neighbor name=has-basic-functional-unit>
   A <slot>has-basic-functional-unit</slot> is more specific than 
   <slot>has-part</slot>. It refers to the many identical things that 
   combine functionally to make up a whole.
 </neighbor>
