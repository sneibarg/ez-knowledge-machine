<superconcept name=Role>

  <definition>
    Instrument-Role is the role played by things, such as tools, used by
    an <conceptref name=Agent-Role> in some <conceptref name=Event>. For
    example, if a person travels by bike, then the bike is an
    Instrument-Role. 
    More precisely, the person who participates in the Move 
    is an <slot>agent</slot>, the bike is an
    <slot>instrument</slot>, and the bike is playing the role of Instrument-Role.
  </definition>

<requiredslotlist>
   <slot>played-by</slot> and <slot>in-event</slot> are required for 
   any object filling a Role, such as Agent. 
   Except for those 2 slots, there are no other slots required for an Agent.
</requiredslotlist>

     <text>The murder weapon is a kitchen knife.</text>
     <slotdescription name=in-event>murder</slotdescription>
     <slotdescription name=played-by>kitchen knife</slotdescription>
  </examplesentence>
  <comment>
     The Instrument-Role in this example is Weapon, and it is played by the kitchen
     knife.

  <examplesentence>
     <text>He used a rock to hit the nail. </text>
     <slotdescription name=in-event>hit the nail</slotdescription>
     <slotdescription name=played-by>rock</slotdescription>
  <comment>
     The Instrument-Role in this example is implicit. Because the rock is used as an
     instrument in the hitting event, the role is Instrument-Role.
