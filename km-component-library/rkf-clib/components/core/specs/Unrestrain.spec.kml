  <neighbor name=Unobstruct> 
     Unobstruct is more general than Unrestrain.
     Unobstruct removes some obstacle, thereby allowing some object to
     move more freely.  In contrast, Unrestrain (more specifically)
     removes all the restraints from an object, thereby allowing it 
     complete freedom of movement.
