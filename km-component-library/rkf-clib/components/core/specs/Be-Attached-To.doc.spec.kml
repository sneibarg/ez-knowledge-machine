<musing>
Be-Attached-To respresents an asymmetric connection between two entities.
One entity (the <slot>object</slot>) is restricted in movement relative
to the other entity (the <slot>base</slot>). In particular, the
<slot>object</slot> of the Be-Attached-To can only be the object of
<conceptref name=Move>s in which the <slot>path</slot> is the 
<slot>location</slot> of the <slot>base</slot> entity of the
Be-Attached-To state. This is probably overly restrictive.<p>

An object is put into a Be-Attached-To state by an <conceptref name=Attach>
action. The object is taken out of the Be-Attached-To state by a
<conceptref name=Detach> action. Note that the <slot>base</slot> of
the <conceptref name=Attach> corresponds to the <slot>base</slot> of
the Be-Attached-To, but the <slot>base</slot> slot of the
<conceptref name=Detach> refers to the <slot>base</slot> of the 
Be-Attached-To.
