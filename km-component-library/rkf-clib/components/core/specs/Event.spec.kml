<concept name=Event>
<superconcept name=Thing>

<hr>
<h3>Component Semantics:</h3>
<component tag=Event>
  <definition>"Things that happen", such as <conceptref name=Action>s and 
     <conceptref name=State>s, as opposed to "Things that are".
</definition>
</component>

<musing>
This is the top level concept for <conceptref name=Action>s and
<conceptref name=State>s.<p>

Contrast Events with <conceptref name=Entity> concepts.
