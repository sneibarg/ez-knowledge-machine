Obstruct is the top-level concept for actions that prevent various kinds
of movement. Since Obstruct does not prevent any specific kind of movement,
this concept is somewhat vacuous. Nonetheless, it results in the 
<slot>object</slot> being in a <conceptref name=Be-Obstructed> 
state, which can be undone by <conceptref name=Unobstruct>ing the 
<slot>object</slot>. It might prove useful for testing if an 
Entity is completely free to move. (It wouldn't be if it's in a 
<conceptref name=Be-Obstructed> state).
