	(description ("Instances of this class are things that do not necessarily exist but serve to represent what is within the scope of non-abnormal posssibility.  Instances of this class should be instance of another class which we refer to here as the reference class.  The name of instances of this class should be of the form `*Detailed-Instance-of-Foo' such that Foo corresponds to its reference class.  For example, to express the fact that `It is not unusual for some laptop computers to have a sound card' one could reify *Detailed-Instance-of-Laptop-Computer and assert that it has a Sound-Card as a part.  In contrast, see Typical-Instance."))
