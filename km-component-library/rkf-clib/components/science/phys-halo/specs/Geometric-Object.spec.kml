<concept name=Geometric-Object>
<superconcept name=Spatial-Entity>

<definition>
	A <conceptref name=Spatial-Entity> describing objects in 2D geometry.
</definition>

<neighborlist>
  <neighbor name=Line>
	A Geometric-Object with no geometric properties (i.e. area, volume, etc.) except for length.  
  </neighbor>
  <neighbor name=Point>
  	A Geometric-Object with no geometric properties such as area, volume, height, etc. It is 
	simply an indefinitely small space.
  </neighbor>
  <neighbor name=Circle>
	A Geometric-Object bounded by a single curve line called its circumference, every part of 
	which is equally distant from its center.
  </neighbor>
  <neighbor name=Polygon>
  	A Geometric-Object bounded by <conceptref name=Line-Segment>s.
  </neighbor>
