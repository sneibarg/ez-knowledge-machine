;; This class allows us to call Compute-Dissociation-Percentage 
;; when a test question refers to dissociation instead of calling
;; Compute-Ionization-Percentage when the question refers to 
;; dissociation. The code in Compute-Ionization-Percentage handles
;; both ionization and dissociation

(Compute-Dissociation-Percentage has
  (superclasses (Compute-Ionization-Percentage))
)
