<concept name=Strong-Electrolyte>

<superconcept name=Ionic-Compound>

  <definition>
    A substance that is completely ionized in solution, for example strong <conceptref name=Acid>s, strong <conceptref name=Base>s and most <conceptref name=Salt>s
  </definition>

</primaryslotlist>

<neighborlist>

   <neighbor name=Salt>
     An Ionic-Compound formed by replacing one or more 
     <conceptref name=Hydrogen-Atom>s of an <conceptref name=Acid>
     by other <conceptref name=Cation>
  </neighbor>

   <neighbor name=Acid>
     An Ionic-Compound that is able to donate a 
     <conceptref name=Hydrogen-Ion> (a <conceptref name=Proton>)
     and hence increases the <slot>concentration</slot> of 
     <conceptref name=Hydrogen-Atom>s when it dissolves in water

  </neighbor>

   <neighbor name=Base>
     An Ionic-Compound that is an <conceptref name=Hydrogen-Ion>
     acceptor
  </neighbor>

   <neighbor name=Molecular-Compound>
      A Chemical that consists of (non-ionic) molecules
  </neighbor>
