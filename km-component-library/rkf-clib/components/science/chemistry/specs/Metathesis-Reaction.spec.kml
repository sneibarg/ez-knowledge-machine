  <definition>
    A Metathesis-Reaction (aka exchange reaction) is the kind of reaction in which positive ions and negative ions appear to exchange partners conform to the following general equation: AX + BY -> AY + BX.

  <neighbor name=Mix>
     A Mix differs from a Reaction in the sense that it does not result in chemically different substances.
  </neighbor>

  <neighbor name=Reaction>
     A Reaction is more general than Metathesis-Reaction, it could refer to the formation of any new chemically different substances.
