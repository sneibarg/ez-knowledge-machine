<h3>Component Semantics:</h3>
<component tag=Oxido-Reductase>
  <definition> General name for an enzyme that catalyzes reactions                          in which one molecule is oxidized and the other is                          reduced.  Enzymes of this type are often called                          oxidases, reductases, and dehydrogenases.                          Alberts:ECB:168. </definition>
