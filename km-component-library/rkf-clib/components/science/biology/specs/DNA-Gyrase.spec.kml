<h3>Component Semantics:</h3>
<component tag=DNA-Gyrase>
  <definition> A protein which binds to DNA and relieves torsional                          strain generated by DNA unwinding <conceptref name=during> replication.                          see Lehninger:PBC:943.                          An ATP-requiring enzyme which, in the presence of                           magnesium ions, introduces negative supertwists into                          closed and possibly linear duplex DNA. The enzyme is                           implicated in DNA replication and transcription. It                          <conceptref name=causes> the storage of mechanical strain energy in the                          superhelical turns of DNA at the expense of <conceptref name=ATP>                          hydrolysis.
