<h3>Component Semantics:</h3>
<component tag=DNA-Replication>
  <definition> A process by which a copy of all or part of a DNA molecule or                   DNA strand is made.  Includes the replication of the replicon                   subunits of DNA and repair of damaged strands. Souther. </definition>
