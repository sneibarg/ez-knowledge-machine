<h3>Component Semantics:</h3>
<component tag=Gene-Expression>
  <definition> The process by which a gene exerts its effect on a                            cell or an organism, usually by directing the                             synthesis of an mRNA molecule that can be translated                             into a protein with a characteristic activity.                            Alberts:ECB:G-8.  The product of gene expression may                            also be rRNA or tRNA.  Souther. </definition>
