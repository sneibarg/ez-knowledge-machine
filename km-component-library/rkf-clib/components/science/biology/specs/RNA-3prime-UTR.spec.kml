<h3>Component Semantics:</h3>
<component tag=RNA-3prime-UTR>
  <definition> The sequence at the end of the mRNA which                                        is not translated.  In eucaryotes, it is                                        partly trimmed and a poly-A tail is                                        added. Souther. </definition>
