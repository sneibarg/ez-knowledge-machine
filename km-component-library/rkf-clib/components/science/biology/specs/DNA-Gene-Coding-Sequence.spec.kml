<h3>Component Semantics:</h3>
<component tag=DNA-Gene-Coding-Sequence>
  <definition> Physical and functional unit of heredity, which carries                          information from one generation to the next.  In                          molecular terms, it is the entire DNA sequence -                          including exons, introns, and noncoding transcription                          control regions - necessary for production of a                          functional protein or RNA. (Lodish:MCB:G-7).                          Note: this is the definition for gene, but applies to                          operons as well. </definition>
