<h3>Component Semantics:</h3>
<component tag=Protein-Complex>
  <definition> A group of proteins which act together to provide                          structure or perform some function.  They are often                          held together by weak bonds such as hydrogen bonds.                          Examples: histones and the mitotic spindle. Souther. </definition>
