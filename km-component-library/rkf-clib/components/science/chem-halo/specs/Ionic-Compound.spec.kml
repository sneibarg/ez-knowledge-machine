<concept name=Ionic-Compound>

<superconcept name=Chemical-Entity>

  <definition>
    A type of chemical composed of an ionic molecule, containing a
    <conceptref name=Cation> and an <conceptref name=Anion>
  </definition>

<primaryslotlist>

  <slotdescription name=has-basic-structural-unit>
    the type of <conceptref name=Molecule>s which comprise this
    Ionic-Compound.  Used to specify the type of <conceptref name=Anion>s
    and <conceptref name=Cation>s in this Ionic-Compound
  </slotdescription>

</primaryslotlist>

<neighborlist>

   <neighbor name=Salt>
     An Ionic-Compound formed by replacing one or more 
     <conceptref name=Hydrogen-Atom>s of an <conceptref name=Acid>
     by other <conceptref name=Cation>s
  </neighbor>

   <neighbor name=Acid>
     An Ionic-Compound that is able to donate a 
     <conceptref name=Hydrogen-Ion> (a <conceptref name=Proton>)
     and hence increases the <slot>concentration</slot> of 
     <conceptref name=Hydrogen-Atom>s when it dissolves in water

  </neighbor>

   <neighbor name=Base>
     An Ionic-Compound that is an <conceptref name=Hydrogen-Ion>
     acceptor
  </neighbor>

   <neighbor name=Molecule>
      A Chemical that consists of (non-ionic) molecules
