<superconcept name=Thing>
  <definition>
  A Chemical-Formula is a linearly ordered collection of pairs of subscript and Chemical-Entity.
  </definition>

<recquireslotlist>
  <slotdescription name=term>
     The sequence of terms in the chemical formula.
  </slotdescription>

<musing>
Chemical-Formula is used to represent both molecular-formulae and empirical-formulae, since there is no sctutural difference between them. Note that a molecular formula is the filler of the <slot>moelcular-formula</slot> slot; similar for empirical-formula.
