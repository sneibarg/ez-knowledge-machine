<concept name=Precipitate>

<superconcept name=Chemical>

  <definition>
    An insoluble substance that forms in, and separates from, a
    water <conceptref name=Solution> (Brown, et.al)
  </definition>

<primaryslotlist>
  <slotdescription name=result-of>
    The <conceptref name=Reaction> that creates this precipitate
  </slotdescription>
</primaryslotlist>

<neighborlist>

   <neighbor name=Acid>
     A precipitate that is able to donate a 
     <conceptref name=Hydrogen-Ion> (a <conceptref name=Proton>)
     and hence increases the <slot>concentration</slot> of 
     <conceptref name=Hydrogen-Atom>s when it dissolves in water
  </neighbor>

   <neighbor name=Base>
     A precipitate that is an <conceptref name=Hydrogen-Ion>
     acceptor
  </neighbor>

   <neighbor name=Salt>
     An <conceptref name=Ionic-Compound> formed by replacing one or more 
     <conceptref name=Hydrogen-Atom>s of an <conceptref name=Acid>
     by other <conceptref name=Cation>s
  </neighbor>
