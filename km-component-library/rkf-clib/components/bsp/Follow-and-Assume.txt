Follow-and-assume (A). 
=================. 
1. Follow and assume is a tactical mission task in which a second committed force follows a force conducting an offensive operation and is prepared to continue the mission if the lead force is fixed, attritted, or unable to continue. 
2. The follow-and-assume force is not a reserve but is committed to accomplish specific tasks. 
 
3. Tasks for a follow-and-assume force include: 
- Preparing to execute all missions of the followed unit. 
- Maintaining contact with the trail elements of the leading force. 
- Preparing to conduct a forward passage of lines through the force it is following. 
- Monitoring all combat information and intelligence being provided to and from the force it is following. 
- Avoiding engaging enemy forces bypassed by the force it is following.
