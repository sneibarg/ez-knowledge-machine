Fix (E). 
===. 
1. Fix is a tactical mission task where a commander prevents the enemy from moving any part of his force from a specific location for a specific period. 
2. This may occur by engaging him to prevent his withdrawal for use elsewhere, or by using deception, such as transmitting false orders. 
3. Fixing an enemy force does not mean destroying it. 
The friendly force has to prevent the enemy from moving in any direction. 
4. The tactical mission task of fix differs from that of block in that a fixed enemy force cannot move from a given location, but a blocked enemy force can move in any direction other than the one obstructed.
