--------------------------------------- 
 
Attack-by-fire (A). 
 
1. Attack-by-fire is a tactical mission task in which a commander uses direct fires, supported by indirect fires, to engage an enemy without closing with him to destroy, suppress, fix, or deceive him. 
2. A commander assigning this task to a subordinate must also state the desired effect on the enemy, such as neutralize, fix, or disrupt. 
3. An attack by fire closely resembles the task of support by fire. 
The chief difference is that one unit conducts the support-by-fire task to support another unit so it can maneuver against the enemy.
