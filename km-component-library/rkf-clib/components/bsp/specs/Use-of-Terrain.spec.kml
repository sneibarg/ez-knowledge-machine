<description>
In a military situation, each commander tries to position his/her troops and equipment so as to take advantage of advantageous terrain features (such as hills) and minimize the effects of potentially difficult terrain (such as swamps).  Each COA will be judged by how well it takes into account the terrain (matched with the force/equipment using the terrain).

<example>
Have I used the terrain to mask my approach to the enemy's positions?<br><br>
Have I avoided open areas (when possible)?<br><br>
Have I avoided areas where my equipment or troops could become bogged down (when possible)?<br><br>
Have I chosen paths through the terrain that decrease the length I need to travel?<br><br>
Have I chosen paths through the terrain that maximize my speed or best maintain a good pace?<br><br>
Have I taken advantage of available roadways, bridges, etc.?<br><br>
