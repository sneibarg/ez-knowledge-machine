<description>
A COA should bring all of the maneuver and fire support elements to bear on the enemy in a timely manner.  This means bringing air and artillery assets as well as the shock action of maneuver onto the enemy in an overwhelming fashion.  As an example, lower air space has to be synchronized so that Blue artillery shells and helicopters are not flying in the same space at the same time.

<example>
Is the timing of the main and supporting attacks synchronized to maximize the effect of the main attack?<br><br>
Are supporting fires planned throughout the conduct of the attack to suppress enemy combat power in accordance with the maneuver plan?<br><br>
