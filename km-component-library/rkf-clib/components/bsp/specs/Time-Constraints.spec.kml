<description>
A commander must consider the time constraints imposed by mission directive and the forces/equipment in use during the COA.
</description>

<example>
Is it possible to position units by the planned start of the mission?<br><br>
Is it possible to continue to meet any synchronization requirements after the start of the mission?<br><br>
Is it possible to complete the mission within any imposed time constraints?<br><br>
Are there time constraints that cannot be met because of physical time/distance factors?<br><br>
</example>

</kml>
