<description>
The commander must consider the physical means for exercising command and control during the conduct of an operation.  That is, all elements must be able to communicate and send/receive intelligence during the course of the operation.  For example, mountainous battlefields can present communication issues due to interruption of line-of-sight FM radio communications and/or excessive communication distances between stations.

<example>
Does this COA present any problems with respect to line of sight communications?<br><br>
Have adequate countermeasures been taken to mitigate any communications problems?<br><br>
Does the commander have the capability to personally "see the battlefield"?<br><br>
