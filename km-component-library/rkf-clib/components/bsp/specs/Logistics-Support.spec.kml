<description>
Commander must consider the ease of logistic supportability in any COA.  That is, the ability to secure lines of communication, and to provide necessary supplies and special equipment at the right time and place (e.g., bridging assets at the river crossing site).
</description>

<example>
Are there any time/distance/location constraints such that supplies could not be delivered as needed?<br><br>
Are securable lines of communications provided for in this COA?<br><br>
Are forward supply points provided for in this COA?<br><br>
</example>
