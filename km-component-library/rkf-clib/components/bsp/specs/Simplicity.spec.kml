<description>
Simplicity is an important principle to observe generally.  COAs that rely on the precise timing of many components that are not directly controlled by the executing headquarters are often victims of the "fog of war" to a greater extent than the simple operations that can be controlled predictably.

<example>
Is there a high degree of interdependency between mission tasks?<br><br>
Are sequential decision points under the control of the commander (this allows for command clarity)?<br><br>
Are the COA maneuvers relatively uncomplicated (going by direct routes without unduly giving away the intent and the security of the maneuver)?<br><br>
</example>
