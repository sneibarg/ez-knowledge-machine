------------------- 
 
Retain (A). 
======. 
1. Retain is a tactical mission task in which the commander ensures that a terrain feature controlled by a friendly force remains free of enemy occupation or use. 
2. The commander assigning this task must specify the area to retain and the duration of the retention, which is time- or event-driven. 
3. While a unit is conducting this task, it expects the enemy to attack and prepares to become decisively engaged. 
4. A unit tasked to retain a specific piece of terrain does not necessary have to occupy it.
