=======. 
1. Destroy is a tactical mission task that physically renders an enemy force combat-ineffective until it is reconstituted. 
2. Alternatively, to destroy a combat system is to damage it so badly that it cannot perform any function or be restored to a usable condition without being entirely rebuilt. 
3. The amount of damage needed to render a unit combat-ineffective depends on the unit's type, discipline, and morale.
