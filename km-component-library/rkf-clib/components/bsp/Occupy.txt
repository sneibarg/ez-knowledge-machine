Occupy (A). 
======. 
1. Occupy is a tactical mission task that involves moving a friendly force into an area so that it can control that area. 
2. Both the force's movement to and occupation of the area occur without enemy opposition. 
3. A unit can control an area without occupying it, but not vice versa. 
4. Units typically occupy assembly areas, objectives, and defensive positions.
