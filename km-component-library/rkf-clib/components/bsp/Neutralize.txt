Neutralize (E). 
==========. 
1. Neutralize is a tactical mission task that results in rendering enemy personnel or materiel incapable of interfering with a particular operation. 
2. When assigning a task to neutralize, the commander must specify the enemy force or materiel to neutralize and the duration, which is time- or event-driven. 
3. The neutralized target may become effective again when casualties are replaced, damage is repaired, or effort resulting in the neutralization is lifted. 
4. The commander normally uses a combination of lethal and nonlethal fires to neutralize enemy personnel or materiel. 
5. The assets required to neutralize a target vary according to the type and size of the target and the weapon and munitions combination used.
