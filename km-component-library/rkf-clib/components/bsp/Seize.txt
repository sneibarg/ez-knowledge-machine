Seize (A). 
=====. 
1. Seize is a tactical mission task that involves taking possession of a designated area by using overwhelming force. 
2. An enemy force can no longer place direct fire on an objective that has been seized. 
3. This task differs from secure because it requires offensive action to obtain control of the designated area or objective. 
4. It differs from the task of occupy because it involves overcoming anticipated enemy opposition. 
5. Once a force seizes a physical objective, it clears the terrain within that objective by killing, capturing, or forcing the withdrawal of all enemy forces.
