Clear 
  superclass: Tactical-Mission-Task 
  superclass: Remove?? (Wordnet sense 5) 
  agent: Military-Unit <----> Actor 
  object:  Military-Unit <---->  Acted on 
  base: Place +NS <----> Location 
  
   by-means-of:   (one or more of) 
         Destroy  (see below) 
         Capture  (appendix) 
         Retreat  (appendix) 
 
Note: This seems like a remove to me, but the stringent "parts" requirement would have to be relaxed.

Clear (A). 
=====. 
1. Clear is a tactical mission task that requires the commander to remove all enemy forces and eliminate organized resistance within an assigned area. 
2. The force does this by destroying, capturing, or forcing the withdrawal of enemy forces so they cannot interfere with the friendly unit's mission. 
3. This task requires significant time and other resources.
